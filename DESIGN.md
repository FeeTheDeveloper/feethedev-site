# Fee The Developer Design System

## Overview

### Creative North Star

The interface behaves like a calm systems console: connected signals, legible status, and selective illumination show clients where their work stands without turning the product into a sci-fi prop.

### Product context and register

- **Audience and primary job:** Prospective clients compare services and prices; signed-in clients orient themselves, reach project resources, and join Fee The Developer communities.
- **Target market:** United States service businesses and operators, based on maintained site configuration and copy.
- **Locale:** English (`en-US`).
- **Usage scene:** Mobile and desktop, occasional client check-ins, low-to-medium information density.
- **Register:** Hybrid. Public routes are brand-led; `/dashboard` is product-led and quieter.
- **Memorable signature:** A signal rail that turns service, project, and community touchpoints into one connected path. On `/work`, the rail groups verified examples by Build, Connect, and Strengthen without flattening their distinct client identities. External learning records are presented as individual continuing education, never as company certification or platform endorsement.
- **Restraint:** Client data, navigation, status, and calls to action remain familiar, stable, and easy to scan.
- **Anti-references:** Generic white SaaS dashboards; excessive neon decoration; fake metrics or unsupported client activity.
- **Token ownership/runtime mapping:** This file documents the canonical values implemented in `tailwind.config.ts` and `styles/globals.css`. Runtime token changes must update this document in the same change.

## Colors

Background and panel colors establish depth. Electric blue is the primary interactive accent, green communicates active/ready states, and orange is reserved for emphasis. Silver and muted blue-gray provide text hierarchy. Focus rings use green or electric blue and never rely on color alone.

## Typography

Manrope is the shared display, body, and utility family. Headings use restrained uppercase only for short labels or brand statements. Body copy remains sentence case with a readable 65–75 character measure. Numeric prices use tabular alignment where comparison matters.

## Layout

Public pages use the shared 80rem shell and generous section rhythm. The dashboard uses a compact product header, a two-column desktop grid, and a single-column mobile flow. Content owns document scrolling; panels do not trap scroll. Persistent geometry is reserved for loading and empty states.

## Elevation & Depth

Hierarchy comes from tonal panels, one-pixel translucent borders, limited blur, and soft shadows. Interactive cards may lift slightly; operational dashboard cards do not scale so scanning remains stable. Public media and portfolio cards may add a pointer-driven perspective tilt (`components/Tilt3D.tsx`, at most about 6°) with a soft following glare; it is limited to fine-pointer devices, never applies to dashboard surfaces, and is removed under reduced motion.

## Shapes

Pills are reserved for status and short actions. Content panels use 1.25–1.5rem radii. Small controls use 0.75–1rem radii. Borders remain thin and quiet.

## Components

### Foundational visual states

Interactive elements provide default, hover, focus-visible, active, disabled, and busy states. Empty states explain the next useful action. Loading uses a stable app-owned indicator. Motion is removed under reduced-motion preferences.

### Buttons and actions

Primary actions use solid or luminous treatments; secondary actions use quiet outlined surfaces. Labels describe the outcome. External destinations include an external-link cue in text or accessible naming.

### Navigation and data display

Public navigation exposes Services, Work, Pricing, and Client portal. Product navigation marks the current destination. Lists favor semantic markup and explicit statuses over decorative charts. Portfolio cards use explicit Live presentation, Review build, or Technical case study labels.

### Forms and overlays

Clerk owns authentication fields and validation. App forms use visible labels, app-owned errors, and `noValidate`. No browser-native alert, confirm, or prompt dialogs are used.

### Iconography

Icons are simple inline SVG strokes at 20–24px. Text labels remain present for primary navigation and actions.

### Motion

Motion suggests signal flow and state change. The public homepage uses one continuous signal-current composition: a deliberate hero entrance, a scroll-progress rail, scrubbed statement text, and scale/fade media transitions. GSAP owns this page-level choreography; routine component transitions remain 180–700ms with custom ease-out curves. The homepage hero adds a decorative 3D signal field (`components/three/`): a brand-colored node network with packets travelling along its links, slow pointer parallax, and a scroll-linked drift. It is plain three.js loaded after hydration, stays quiet behind the headline via a contrast mask, pauses off-screen, and is not rendered for reduced-motion visitors or browsers without WebGL. Ambient audio is optional, starts only after a visitor activates the labeled control, and never autoplays. Routine dashboard interaction remains quiet. Reduced-motion users receive static states.

### Content and data visualization

The voice is direct, specific, and client-centered. Status copy never implies live project data or connected services unless backed by a real source.

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do:** Keep public and portal routes recognizably part of the same signal system.
- **Do:** Label unavailable or unconfigured destinations honestly.
- **Don't:** Invent project progress, subscriber counts, testimonials, or financial terms.
- **Don't:** Trade navigation clarity or contrast for atmospheric effects.
